 * This project seems very similar to the Grumblr app that you are developing for your homeworks (with the addition of chatting, which many groups have attempted in the past). As of right now, I do not think that there will be enough work to share amongst 3 people due to this similarity to the homework. How do you think you can elevate the webapp more? Some considerations might be incorporating some web API's to have more rich data to work with, instead of manually creating small dataset/user base. You might also want to explore some different functionality (more than the basic social network functions).

 * I'm worried that your app might sound and operate a lot like grumblr but with items instead of posts and an extra recommendation system built in. How involved is this recommendation system? In order to do adequate testing, it sounds like you might need a lot of users and a lot of data. I think it'd be a better use of your time learning something more web-related like an API or web-based technology.

 * I'm personally a bit concerned that this webapp is too similar to Grumblr. The idea can probably still be developed. However, most of the main features of your webapp is pretty much the same stuff that you implemented in Grumblr. It's good that you guys have thought about building an interesting recommendation system but you also want to look for interesting webapp features. One direction is to think of third party APIs/libraries that you can integrate into your webapp. An idea may be to integrate social media into your webapp, like using the Facebook API.
